## Feedback
This is a well thought out plan, and the modeling progression makes sense. For the experiments, the main thing to verify early is that your train and test splits exactly follow the benchmark procedure (not just the split proportion), since even small differences in sample ordering or grouping can shift balanced accuracy noticeably (and maybe this is not an issue, but double checking would be nice). You should also inspect the nPrint feature encoding before running the classifiers, because OS detection hinges on subtle byte-pattern features, and any mismatch in how those are hashed or padded will directly affect the usefulness of linear models and the gap between your results and the leaderboard.
